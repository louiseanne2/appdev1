Bug fix

By doing this activity, I understood the significant difference between macro commits and micro commits in Git.
A macro commit is when multiple unrelated changes are committed together in one commit.
Although it might be convenient, it is confusing when looking back at history because the message of the commit does not describe each change distinctly.
