Base work

By doing this exercise, I understood that git rebase produces a neater, linear history of commits by pushing the commits of one branch over another.
Rather than merging, which maintains two divergent lines of development, rebasing replays the commit history in such a way as though the feature branch work was done subsequent to the hotfix.
The result of this is that the timeline of the project is significantly easier to read and understand.
